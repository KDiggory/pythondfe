num=(100/5)
print(num)

num1 = 5 ## python doesnt need you to specify the type of variable
num2 = 10

answer = num1 + num2
print(answer)

answer2 = num1/3 ## this is now a float, it automatically sees that
## you can however tell it what you want them as if you want to do (float(7))

num3 = float(input("enter a number: "))
num4 = float(input("Enter another number: ")) ## when getting input you need to put the type so that someone cant put the wrong type in 
answer3 = num3 + num4
print(num3, " + ", num4, " = ", answer3)
