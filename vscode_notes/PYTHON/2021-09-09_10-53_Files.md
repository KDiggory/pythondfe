~~~~ Files ~~~~~

.docx, .txt and .pdf All store data - could be text.
The data is stored differently in them

pdf and docx (to a lesser format) store the data in a binary format. Not able to be interpreted by humans, needs a program that takes the stream of data into something visual

txt format stores things in character data!

In python there are many modules for saving your data as different formats - they require the download of a pip module.
One that saves files in standard text format (ASCII) is built in (don't need to mess with it to get). Don't even need to import the module in.

open - open is a built in function to open files. use help(open) to look at it.

file = open(<filename>)
print(file) --> this produces the metadata for the file but not the contents
print(file.read()) --> this prints the contents of the file

Can then specify more about this eg, particular lines or characters. Very useful with tabular data, eg when you are transferring data from an excel file to a database for example. 

print(file.read()) 

What can you do with a python file that couldnt with just an excel file
csv of names emails and 3 grades - in excel could make a final grade
but caan use python to produce another file containing this data - eg email format 
need to uise html to make the certificates from the data, and can then use a pdf converter to make a pdf from that. This is what the file leonsworkingcertmaker does!
